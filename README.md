# QuickRestart
 A simple mod for Lethal Company that allows the host to initiate the "Fired" cutscene at any point in the playthrough.

 ## Usage
 When your ship is in orbit, type `/restart` into the chat to initiate a restart. The mod will ask you to `CONFIRM` or `DENY` your restart. Typing `DENY` into chat will abort the restart, and typing `CONFIRM` into chat will initiate the "You have been fired" cutscene after a few seconds and cause your game to end.

 ## Installation
 Requires the latest version of [BepInEx 5](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx). After BepInEx has been installed, drag `QuickRestart.dll` into the `BepInEx/plugins` folder in the game's root directory. Ensure that the host of the game is using the mod, non-host players will not be able to restart the game.
